# Novel View Synthesis with Style Transfer via 3D feature embeddings
The advent of adversarial models has given rise to very powerful image synthesis. However, despite the rich depth in 2D image models, mathematical models of 3D environments have not been explored thoroughly. We propose to apply a hybrid generational model for style transfer upon an underlying 3D scene structure.
